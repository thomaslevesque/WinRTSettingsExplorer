WinRTSettingsExplorer
=====================
There is no easy way to view and edit Windows Store app settings. The normal way is to load the settings.dat file as a registry hive in regedit, which isn't very convenient to start with, and even then, you have to manually decode the values. This app attempts to make things easier, by providing a simple UI to view and edit settings for all Windows Store apps.

(work in progress; the UI is still very basic, and editing is only supported for some data types)
